# CompRobo Mini-Project
### Writeup
See my full writeup [on Notion](https://bf01.notion.site/Mini-Project-f102e00a0c47462e9b800e93a903dc07?pvs=4).

### Installing
Please note that the teleop node requires `pynput` as an external dependency for handling inputs. On linux it also requires X11 to function properly.

### Bags
Bag files are located on my [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16wggg7LopFvE9xY_xDXoza3XT_DadnLD?usp=sharing).
